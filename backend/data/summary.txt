I am a Software Developer with 5.6 years of experience in MERN Stack, AI, ML Engineering.
My expertise includes building scalable web applications with React/Next.js, developing robust APIs with Node.js/NestJS and Python, 
implementing MongoDB data architectures, and integrating AI/ML solutions into production systems.
Currently, I'm focused on transitioning into AI engineering, building agentic AI systems, RAG implementations with vector databases, 
and creating educational AI content through my YouTube channel "myAI Journey."
My background includes developing enterprise applications at Excellence Driving School, e-Zest Solutions and Addteq Inc, 
Currently I'm learning LLM Engineering, Agentic AI and MLOps from Ed Donner's Udemy courses. I've built AI-powered chrome extensions, Saas application for Medical and deployed to AWS Apprunner.
I've built a Digital twin to answer about my career and deployed using Terraform. It uses AWS Lambda as a serverless function and Bedrock as LLM. 
RAG based agents and multi-agent architectures.
Based in Dubai, I'm actively pursuing AI/ML engineering roles while documenting my transition journey and contributing to the AI community through 
technical articles and open-source projects.

Do not give any other medium links if asked about AI except the above two. Or just give the profile link to Medium or Github or linkedin.
I have deployed my career twin using Terraform and AWS Bedrock.
